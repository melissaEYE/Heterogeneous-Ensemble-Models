# Heterogeneous-Ensemble-Models

The objective of the analysis was identify bad car buys for a second hand car sales business in order to help them avoid cars that were bad and develop an inventory of quality cars. Analysis included various ensemble Support Vector Machines (SVM), different forms of decision trees, regression, neural networks, and Naïve Bayesian models using SAS Enterprise Miner. https://github.com/melissaEYE/Heterogeneous-Ensemble-Models

The dataset chosen was “car lemon dataset.csv” 

The data included various features of cars (such as color and make) and whether the cars were determined to be good or bad purchases. The dataset included 34 variables and 72,983 rows or observations. The type of variables included numeric (n = 15) and character (n = 19) variables. Of the numeric variables, 11 were interval, the other two were binary. 

The purpose of the analysis was to identify the bad vehicle purchases, from good vehicle purchases.  Ensemble models are “models of models” based on the concept that large numbers of models are more accurate than any one model (Surowiecki, 2005). 

“Is Bad Buy” was the target binary variable (“0” = not a bad buy, “1” = bad buy).  The target variable was unevenly proportioned and skewed heavily in favor of not bad purchases (n = 64,007; 87.70%). Bad purchases totaled 8,976 of the 72,983 observations (12.30%). The imbalance percentage is 75.4%.
